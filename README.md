# showRSS

Script to generate rss feed for ongoing shows by parsing torrent index.
Inspired from showRss.info (it's a great website but it doesnt have anime).

Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MVasuki1/showRSS/main/rss/1.rss` to qBittorrent RSS feed and setup download rule to automatically download ongoing show.

Fork and edit the shows.yml to add a new show and run parser.py <id> to generate rss feed for the show.
